# Hi, I'm Agustin! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile. I'm currently developing university projects. They're not that big of a deal, but I'm slowly but surely consolidating my knowledge.

If you want to know more about what I developed or have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me through my LinkedIn.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm an advanced software engineering student at the Aeronautical University Institute. I'm currently in my fourth year. 

I love studying and gaining knowledge in technology. It's my number one passion. 
Initially, I'm looking for an internship to help me solidify my development knowledge, and if possible, later on, I'll be able to gain experience leading development teams.

Before finding my passion for computer science, I studied electronic engineering for three years. I put in a lot of effort, but when I realized I couldn't see myself working in that field, I decided to embark on my current path. I eventually found the motivation and discipline necessary to move forward.
